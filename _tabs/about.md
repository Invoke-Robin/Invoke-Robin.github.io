Welcome to my blog, Invoke_Robin.

I am a curious and stubborn guy from Sweden who has worked with IT since 2012.  
After 8 years as an on-site technician I became a sysadmin focusing on printing solutions, 3rd line support cases and knowledge base article writing.  
In that role I started scripting with VBA for Excel, and a little bit of PowerShell, setting up semi-automations for order handling and exports. Here is where I learned that I _really_ liked scripting and automating tedious work.

About two years into my sysadmin role I got the opportunity to work primarily with scripting and automation, mainly with:

- PowerShell
- Intune
- MSGraph
- VB Script
- Git
- Azure DevOps

I originally planned to start this blog in 2022 to document my journey as a newbie PowerShell developer. It's now 2025, and while I never made that first post back then, I'm finally starting.

After a couple of years of writing PowerShell I want to give something back to the community. I still consider myself a junior in the role. So the blog will contain everything from thoughts and ideas to fully functional modules and DevOps automations.

Maybe someone will find it useful, maybe some things will be common sense or _far_ from best practice. At the very least, this will be a place for me to look back on my journey.

Feel free to reach out, share your thoughts, or just say hi!
